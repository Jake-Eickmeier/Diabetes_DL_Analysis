# Diabetes_DL_Analysis
An analysis of a diabetes dataset using deep learning. Primarily uses the TensorFlow library with the Keras API.

## Important: Please note that this project is not intended to serve as medical advice in any way. This is simply a means of practicing and demonstrating some deep learning techniques that I am exploring.

## To view the project, simply click on the file "Diabetes_Deep_Learning_Analysis.ipynb", which will display an already-run version using a saved checkpoint of the notebook.
## Otherwise, you are welcome to clone the repository and run the notebook yourself using Jupyter Notebook!
